This project mimics a text editor and samples different functions (like changing text colors, fonts, word count, etc.) 
by employing simple and user friendly gui commands. 
The code to this text editor was written in collaboration with [@nehasdixit](https://github.com/nehasdixit), [@niranjinii](https://github.com/niranjinii), and [@nupur1735](https://github.com/nupur1735).
It has been developed entirely in the python programming language using several pre-defined as well as user-defined modules.
